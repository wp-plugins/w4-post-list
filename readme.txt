W4 Post List lets you create a list of posts, terms, users or a combined one. Decorate output using shortcodes. It's just easy and fun.


== Description ==

Display Posts (any custom post type), Terms (any custom taxonomy), Users (any role) on Content or Widget Areas by placing a shortcode. Select what to show and design how to show it. Using the plugin is really easy. You will find Tinymce button on post/page editor to quickly inset a list. Also, there's a separate page for creating or editing list. 


Creating a list is just few steps. The following options are for `posts` list type. There are different option for different type of list.

= Build Query =
* post type 
* post status
* post mime type
* post taxonomy terms
* post ids
* post parents
* post authors
* post meta ( meta_query )


= Group Results by =
* year
* month
* month year
* category, post tag or custom taxonomies
* authors
* parents

= Order Results by =
* post id
* post title
* post name
* post publish date
* post modified date
* menu order
* approved comment count
* meta value
* or random

= Multi-Page Pagination by =
* Next / Previous links
* Numeric navigation flat - Ex: 1, 2, 3.
* Numeric navigation showing in unordered list. 
* Enable/Disable pagination by ajax


= Creating Template =
Templates are designed using Shortcodes. You can create a simple list just showing post title and linked to the post page, or you can display complex list using any of the information relating to post. Some of the available shortcodes are - 

* post thumbnail
* post categories
* post tags
* post custom taxonomy terms
* post author name / links / avatar
* post publish time
* post modified time
* post excerpt
* post content
* post meta value (multiple times, with multiple meta keys)
* media thumbnail


Check all of the available shortcodes on [W4 Post List Plugin Page](http://w4dev.com/w4-plugin/w4-post-list).
